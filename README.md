# AI-Powered-Real-Time-Smoke-Detection-System
Vehicle emissions significantly impact air quality. Traditional methods like ultraviolet-infrared sensors are accurate but costly, limiting usage. This project proposes a scalable, AI-driven smoke detection system. By leveraging deep learning on live video feeds, it identifies smoke, distinguishing it from non-smoke elements to reduce pollution.
